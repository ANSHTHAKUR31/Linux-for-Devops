  ALL ABOUT 	LINUX

Linux is an open source operating system  and it came from the unix family which is a commercialised operating system.

In Linux everything is represented as a file including a hardware program, the files are stored in a directory, and every directory contains a file with a tree structure. That is called (File System Hierarchy).


Linux uses single rooted , inverted tree like structure .

Root Directory represents with / (forward slash) It is a top-level directory in Linux.

1.   /

The base of the Linux directory is the root. This is the starting point of FSH. Every directory arises from the root directory. It is represented by a forward slash (/). 




2.   /root → 

It is the home directory for the root user which is also known as (Superuser).





3.  /bin → User Binaries

Contains binary executable. 

Common Linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory. 

Commands used by all the users of the system are located here.

/bin = User BinariesBasic commands ka ghar 

Yahin par common commands milti hain jaise:
ls – files/directory list karne ke liye
cd – directory change karne ke liye
mkdir – new directory banane ke liye
cp – copy
mv – move / rename
rm – delete
cat, echo, pwd etc.






4.   /sbin → System Binaries

SystemBinaries Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.

 But, the linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system aministrator, for system maintenance purpose. 

 For example: iptables, reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, swapon





 
5.   /dev → Device files
/dev directory contains special files that represent hardware and virtual devices attached to the system.

Device Files it contains hardware device files, Contains device files.

/dev directory me hardware devices ko represent karne wali special files hoti hain.

Linux me har hardware ko ek file ki tarah treat kiya jata hai, aur wo files /dev ke andar hoti hain.

 These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system. For example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0

/dev me kya hota hai?
Terminal devices
/dev/tty1
/dev/tty2

USB devices
/dev/usbmon0

Hard disks / partitions
/dev/sda
/dev/sda1

Input devices
/dev/mouse
/dev/input/*

Virtual devices
/dev/null
/dev/zero
/dev/random






6.   /var→ Variable Files
   
The variable data files such as log files are located in the /var directory. 

File contents that tend to grow are located in this directory. 

/var contains variable data files such as logs, mail, temporary files, and application data whose size grows over time.

/var/log: System log files generated by OS and other applications.

 /var/lib: Contains database and package files. 
 /var/mail: Contains Emails. 
 /var/tmp: Contains Temporary files needed for reboot.




 
7.   /mnt → Mount Directory
This directory is used to mount a file system temporarily.

/mnt directory ka use temporarily file systems mount karne ke liye hota hai.

ab hum koi external storage ya alag filesystem (USB, CD-ROM, network drive) ko short time ke liye access karna chahte hain, to use /mnt ke andar mount kar dete hain.

Common uses

USB drive
External hard disk
ISO image
Network filesystem (NFS)

    Example : mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
    
Temporary mount ke liye hota hai

Mostly manual mounts ke liye use hota hai

System boot ke time automatically mount karne ke liye usually /mnt use nahi hota




8.   /media→ Removable Media Devices or Removable Media Mount Points
The /media directory contains subdirectories where removable media devices inserted into the computer are mounted.
USB pen drive
External hard disk
CD/DVD
computer me insert karte ho, to system unhe automatically /media ke andar mount kar deta hai.


/mnt	                /media
Manual          temporary mount	Auto mount
Admin use  	   Desktop environment
Short-term	    USB/CD auto-detect




9.   /usr→ Unix System Resources
    
The /usr directory contains applications and files used by users, as opposed to applications and files used by the system.

/usr contains user applications, binaries, libraries, and shared data used by users rather than the core system.

/usr directory me user-level applications, commands aur libraries hoti hain.

Ye normal users ke programs hote hain, system boot karne ke liye essential nahi hote (unlike /bin).

/usr ke common subdirectories

🔹 /usr/bin
Most user commands Examples:
gcc
git
python
vim

🔹 /usr/sbin
Admin/system commands (non-essential for boot) Examples:
apachectl
useradd

🔹 /usr/lib
Libraries used by /usr/bin programs

🔹 /usr/share
Architecture-independent data (man pages, icons, documentation)
/bin = basic survival tools 
/usr = full-featured user programs
/bin vs /usr/bin (quick clarity)


   /bin	                               /usr/bin
Essential commands	           Non-essential user apps
Single-user mode	             Normal multi-user mode
Boot ke liye required	        Boot ke baad mounted






10.   /etc → Configuration files or Editable Text Configuration

It contains all configuration files of server .

The core configuration files are stored in the /etc directory.

It controls the behavior of an operating system or application.

This directory also contains startup and shutdown program scripts that are used to start or stop individual programs.

 Core configuration files
OS aur services ki main settings Examples:
/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
/etc/hostname
/etc/fstab
/etc/resolv.conf

Application / server config files
Web server, DB, SSH, etc. Examples:
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
/etc/apache2/
/etc/ssh/sshd_config

Yahan binary files nahi, mostly text files hote hain , Admin (root) hi usually edit karta hai , Galat change → system ya service crash ho sakti hai ⚠️






11.   /boot → Boot Loader Files or system ka  starting point

The /boot directory contains the files needed to boot the system ,  the GRUB boot loader's files and your Linux kernels are stored here.

/boot me kya hota hai?
🔹 Linux Kernel files
vmlinuz-*
Actual kernel image

🔹 Initial RAM Disk
initrd.img-*
initramfs-* ➡ Boot ke time temporary filesystem provide karta hai

🔹 Boot loader files
GRUB related files Examples:
/boot/grub/
/boot/grub/grub.cfg
/boot ka data critical hota hai  , Galti se delete / corrupt → system boot nahi hoga ⚠️ , Often alag boot partition hota hai.
/boot contains boot loader files, Linux kernel images, and initial RAM disk files required to boot the system.






12.   /opt → Optional Applications

The opt directory is used for installing the application software from thirdparty vendors that are not available in the Linux distribution.

Usually, the software code is stored in the opt directory and the binary code is linked to the bin directory so that all users can run that software.

Ye software usually self-contained hota hai (apni libraries, configs, etc. ke saath).



/opt/								
 └── software_name/
     ├── bin/
     ├── lib/
     ├── etc/

/opt/google/chrome
/opt/oracle
/opt/zoom

Binaries ka use kaise hota hai?
Software ka binary /opt/software/bin me hota hai
Uska link bana diya jata hai ,  /usr/bin/software_name




13.   /home → Home Directory

It contains secondary users home directory.

/home directory me normal (non-root) users ke home directories hote hain.

 Har user ke liye yahan ek alag personal directory hoti hai jahan:

personal files
documents
downloads
user-specific configuration files
store hote hain.

Example
/home/ansh
/home/user1
/home/user2





14.   /tmp → Temporary Files 

Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users .
Files under this directory are deleted when system is rebooted.

/tmp vs /var/tmp (quick recall)

/tmp	                                         /var/tmp
Reboot ke baad delete               	Reboot ke baad bhi rehta
Short-term temp files	                  Long-term temp files
